## Why is this different than Wikipedia about the Supreme Court?
We're the editors. We can in theory dig up all the dirt we can about these powerful people. We can say things the way we want to say them. There is power in owning your own printing press.

## What is this "we" you refer to?
This website will only be interesting and useful if it's not just me. I don't have the time, nor the skills, to do the level of research and investigation to make this content unique and interesting.
