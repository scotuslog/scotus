# Chief Justice John Roberts
President George W. Bush appointed John Glover Roberts Jr. to the Supreme Court in 2005.

Racism is not often seen as radical, but Roberts' radical views on racism came into focus in the 1990 Supreme Court case of Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC. At the time, Roberts argued against the FCC had no business trying to create racial diversity in the pool of radio licensees. He claimed to do so would be unconstitutional. 

## Maine Vacation Property Purchase

According to [the Bangor Daily News in Maine](https://bangordailynews.com/2016/10/24/news/us-supreme-court-chief-justice-john-roberts-buys-home-on-maine-island/), in 2016, John Roberts and his wife purchased a vacation property on an island in Maine.

The Robertses purchased the 1500 square foot Hupper Island on October 7, 2016, the Bangor Daily News reported at the time. 

This second home, reporter Stephen Betts said was larger than the couple's first home. This new home was purchased from Stephen Thomas and Evelyn Blum. Thomas, Betts reported was the host of "This Old House." And interestingly, this isn't the first home that Thomas has sold to the Robertses. In 2006, the Robertses bought the neighboring property to this new home purchase.

The chief justice makes a total annual salary of about $277,700.

According the Bangor Daily News, there is no public record about how much Roberts paid for this nearly 2 acres of exclusive beachfront property located right next to his other exclusive beachfront property he already owned.
