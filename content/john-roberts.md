# Chief Justice John Roberts
Appointed to the Supreme Court by George W. Bush in 2005, John Glover Roberts Jr. is Chief Justice Roberts' legal name.

Roberts' radical views on racism came into focus in the 1990 Supreme Court case Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC. Roberts argued against the FCC had no business trying to create racial diversity in the pool of radio licenses. He claimed to do so would be unconstitutional. 

This view Roberts has of the Constitution as it relates to race is suspect.
