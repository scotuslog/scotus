# Welcome to S.C.O.T.U.S.
This website is about the Supreme Court of the United States of America. One of the first things you will notice about this website is that there is not much content. 

The purpose of this website is to shine some light on the Supreme Court, which operates very much in the dark. 

This site launched quietly in December 2021 with the goal of crowd-sourcing the content, let's see how it goes.

## Supreme Court of the United States of America
Since day one of enacting the Constitution, there's been a Supreme Court. 

James Madison liked the idea of the "national judiciary" constructed as various tribunals chosen by Congress. Others wanted the federal judiciary to be able to veto the president.

In the end, we largely have today what they designed at the time, a small governing body of lawyers on the bench for life, and beholden to no voters.

The first Supreme Court nominated by President George Washington had five justices.
 * John Jay for chief justice
 * John Rutledge
 * William Cushing
 * Robert H. Harrison replaced by James Iredell when Harrison didn't want to do it.
 * James Wilson
 * John Blair Jr. as associate justices.

## Current Supreme Court Justices

## Hard Right Turn
When Scalia died and Mitch McConnell refused to seat President Obama's supreme court nominee Merrick Garland, liberals lost the court for at least a generation.

That was before Hillary Clinton didn't become president January 2017. Donald John Trump became president instead, with the help of Vladimir Putin. Trump filled two more seats, one of which belonged to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

As the court sits today, it's a 6 to 3 court heavily favoring conservatives. As a tool for progressives, the Supreme Court is no longer useful. While some of the left argue the court should be expanded beyond nine justices, it is inconceivable to imagine the Democratic party pulling off such an accomplishment.

Even before Amy Coney Barrett sat in Ginsburg's chair, the Supreme Court was captured by the right. 

[Back in 2019](https://progressive.org/magazine/supremely-conservative-blum/), Michael Avery, professor emeritus of law at Suffolk University Law School in Boston, [said](https://progressive.org/magazine/supremely-conservative-blum/), "With the confirmation of Kavanaugh last October, we now have five current or former members of the Federalist Society on the Supreme Court. If Trump is reelected, there probably will be a sixth at some point."

Trump didn't get reelected but Ginsburg tragically passed away.

It's unclear how this democracy persists after losing the Supreme Court. Already the court has [allowed states to nullify federal law](https://www.alternet.org/2021/12/john-roberts-texas-aboriton/?share_id=6823783), despite objections by Chief Justice Roberts.
