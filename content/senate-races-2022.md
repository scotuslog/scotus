# US Senate Races 2022
Democrats currently have the slimmest majority in the US Senate. Democrats have
50 seats. The GOP has 50 seats. The Dems have Vice President Kamala Harris to put them at 51.

Now that the Supreme Court has struck down Roe, there is pressure on Democratic voters to turn out in November to elect more Dems to the Senate. The idea is that if Dems can get to 60 in the Senate they can overcome the filibuster. Why they can't just get rid of the filibuster is unclear, but Dems are committed to the filibuster. That means they need 60 to overcome the filibuster.

But is it even possible for Dems to get to 60 senators to overcome the GOP's filibuster?

With Harris, Dems will need to pick up 9 seats. So let's look at the races as of
June 24, 2022. If everything goes their way, Dems will pick up 3 seats, assuming that they don't lose any of their existing seats.

# Republican Seats Up for Grabs
## Idaho Mike Crapo NOPE
In 2016, Crapo won by more than 30 points. This seat is not going to go to the Democrats

## North Dakota John Hoeven NOPE
In 2016, Hoeven won by more than 61 points. It's not realistic that Dems will
pick this seat up.

## South Dakota John Thune NOPE
In 2016, Thune won by more than 40 points. Thune isn't seen as beatable.

## Wisconsin Ron Johnson MAYBE
In 2016, Johnson won by just over 3 points. This is a potential pickup for Dems.

## Indiana Todd Young PROBABLY NOT
In 2016, Young won by nearly 10 points. Dems probably won't win this seat, but
there is a slim chance.

## Ohio Rob Portman PROBABLY NOT
In 2016, Portman won by more than 20 points. It's unlikely Dems pick up this seat.

## Pennsylvania Pat Toomey MAYBE
Toomey squeaked out a win in 2016. Dems could conceivably pick up this seat.

## Kentucky Rand Paul NOPE
Paul won in 2016 by nearly 15 points. Paul is expected to win.

## Missouri Roy Blunt NOPE
Blunt didn't crush it in 2016, but he won. Republicans are expected to hold this seat.

## Kansas Jerry Moran NOPE
Moran won by more than 30 points in 2016. Dems aren't going to win this Kansas seat.

## Utah Mike Lee NOPE
Lee won by more than 40 points in 2016. This one is a solid Republican seat.

## Oklahoma James Lankford/Jim Imhofe NOPE
Lankford and Imhofe easily won their seats in 2016 and they're not worried about winning again in 2022.

## Arkansas John Boozman NOPE
Boozman won in 2016 by more than 23 points. This is a solid GOP seat.

## North Carolina Richard Burr PROBABLY NOT
Burr didn't crush it in 2016, he only won by 5.7 points. While this race only "leans Republican," it's likely to stay Republican in 2022.

## South Caroline Tim Scott NOPE
Scott won't be losing his Senate seat this year. In 2016, he won by more than 23 points.

## Alabama Richard Shelby NOPE
Shelby is expected to win his reelection this year.

## Louisiana John Kennedy NOPE
Kennedy won by more than 21 points in 2016. It does not appear Dems will be picking off Kennedy.

## Florida Marco Rubio MAYBE
As far as Republicans go, Rubio is looking week and his opponent is a real threat to him. Dems could knock off Rubio.

## Alaska Lisa Murkowski NOPE
Murkowski is strong in Alaska, she beat a Republican running as an independent with write-in campaign. Dems aren't going to win this seat.
