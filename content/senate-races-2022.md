# US Senate Races 2022
## July 9, 2022 Analysis
The last time I looked at the Senate races about 3 weeks ago, I predicted that the Democrats could net 3 seats. Let's see where things sit now.

Obviously polling data can't predict the future, but it can indicate trends.

Right now, Real Clear Politics has seven Senate seats as toss-ups.
 * Arizona - Kelly Democrat
 * Georgia - Warnock Democrat
 * New Hampshire - Hassan Democrat
 * North Carolina - Open Republican
 * Nevada - Cortez Masto Democrat
 * Pennsylvania - Open Republican
 * Wisconsin - Johnson Republican

 Last month, I had the Dems winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida. 
 
 Looking at how that race between Fetterman and Oz is playing out, I think the Dems have that one locked down. 
 
 Florida is a bit of a long shot. Demmings is not lighting up voters at this point. Based on the polling, Demmings is trailing Rubio by about 9 points. Something needs to happen there to make Florida a reality for Democrats.

 Wisconsin still has primaries to get through before there's a Democrat to poll against, but Johnson is badly damaged at this point. It all depends on who Democrats pick and how much support they get from the party.

 Ohio could definitely break Democrats way. Vance has just a 3 point lead in one poll against Ryan. There's not a lot of polling right now for this race, but I put this one as a legit toss-up. A Dem win here would be huge.

 While the sand keeps shifting, as I did last month, I see the Democrats netting 3 seats in November. That's if Dems don't lose any of their incumbent races.

 That means Dems pick up seats in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. They lose in Florida and North Carolina where they've still got a shot, but those seats were previously held by Republicans. If they do snag one of those two seats, that would pad the Dem majority.

 A lot has to go Democrats way for all of this to happen. And overall attitude in this country is not good, which does not usually bode well for the party in power. More than 57 percent of voters disapprove of Biden's performance. More than 75 percent of the country thinks we're going in the wrong direction. Trump never hit 75 percent, even during the height of the pandemic.

## June 24, 2022 Analysis
Democrats currently have the slimmest majority in the US Senate. Democrats have
50 seats. The GOP has 50 seats. The Dems have Vice President Kamala Harris to put them at 51.

Now that the Supreme Court has struck down Roe, there is pressure on Democratic voters to turn out in November to elect more Dems to the Senate. The idea is that if Dems can get to 60 in the Senate they can overcome the filibuster. Why they can't just get rid of the filibuster is unclear, but Dems are committed to the filibuster. That means they need 60 to overcome the filibuster.

But is it even possible for Dems to get to 60 senators to overcome the GOP's filibuster?

With Harris, Dems will need to pick up 9 seats. So let's look at the races as of
June 24, 2022. If everything goes their way, Dems will pick up 3 seats, assuming that they don't lose any of their existing seats.

# Republican Seats Up for Grabs
## Idaho Mike Crapo NOPE
In 2016, Crapo won by more than 30 points. This seat is not going to go to the Democrats

## North Dakota John Hoeven NOPE
In 2016, Hoeven won by more than 61 points. It's not realistic that Dems will
pick this seat up.

## South Dakota John Thune NOPE
In 2016, Thune won by more than 40 points. Thune isn't seen as beatable.

## Wisconsin Ron Johnson MAYBE
In 2016, Johnson won by just over 3 points. This is a potential pickup for Dems.

## Indiana Todd Young PROBABLY NOT
In 2016, Young won by nearly 10 points. Dems probably won't win this seat, but
there is a slim chance.

## Ohio Rob Portman PROBABLY NOT
In 2016, Portman won by more than 20 points. It's unlikely Dems pick up this seat.

## Pennsylvania Pat Toomey MAYBE
Toomey squeaked out a win in 2016. Dems could conceivably pick up this seat.

## Kentucky Rand Paul NOPE
Paul won in 2016 by nearly 15 points. Paul is expected to win.

## Missouri Roy Blunt NOPE
Blunt didn't crush it in 2016, but he won. Republicans are expected to hold this seat.

## Kansas Jerry Moran NOPE
Moran won by more than 30 points in 2016. Dems aren't going to win this Kansas seat.

## Utah Mike Lee NOPE
Lee won by more than 40 points in 2016. This one is a solid Republican seat.

## Oklahoma James Lankford/Jim Imhofe NOPE
Lankford and Imhofe easily won their seats in 2016 and they're not worried about winning again in 2022.

## Arkansas John Boozman NOPE
Boozman won in 2016 by more than 23 points. This is a solid GOP seat.

## North Carolina Richard Burr PROBABLY NOT
Burr didn't crush it in 2016, he only won by 5.7 points. While this race only "leans Republican," it's likely to stay Republican in 2022.

## South Caroline Tim Scott NOPE
Scott won't be losing his Senate seat this year. In 2016, he won by more than 23 points.

## Alabama Richard Shelby NOPE
Shelby is expected to win his reelection this year.

## Louisiana John Kennedy NOPE
Kennedy won by more than 21 points in 2016. It does not appear Dems will be picking off Kennedy.

## Florida Marco Rubio MAYBE
As far as Republicans go, Rubio is looking week and his opponent is a real threat to him. Dems could knock off Rubio.

## Alaska Lisa Murkowski NOPE
Murkowski is strong in Alaska, she beat a Republican running as an independent with write-in campaign. Dems aren't going to win this seat.
