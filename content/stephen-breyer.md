![Stephen Breyer - Associate Justice of the Supreme Court](%assets_url%/stephen-breyer.jpg)
Nominated by President Bill Clinton, Stephen Breyer has been an associate Supreme Court justice since 1994.

Breyer is one of only three liberal justices on the Supreme Court. The 83-year-old Californian was nominated by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 to be judge on the United States Court of Appeals of the First Circuit.

In 1967, Breyer married royalty. His wife, Joanna Freda Hare is a member of the British aristocracy, the youngest daughter of John Hare, 1st Viscount Blankenham. 

Progressive activists have been urging Breyer to retire while Biden is president. Breyer [has said](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/justice-stephen-breyer-retirement-fox-news-sunday.html) he intends to not "die on the court."
