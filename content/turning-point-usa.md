# Turning Point USA
Founded in 2012, Turning Point USA is a right-wing political non-profit founded by this guy Charlie Kirk.

I'm pretty sure I've blocked him on Twitter, but he's a regular right-wing crank, or crackpot if you will. 

Kirk is like 28 years now, and ten years ago he figured out how to get paid to be an a-hole. I don't doubt that Kirk believes his own right-wing bullshit, but his key attribute other rightwingers is that he's figured out how to make a living off his bullshit - not everyone can do that.

In 2019, Kirk reported to the IRS pulling down nearly $300,000 a year as the President and CEO of Turning Point USA. While $300,000 a year isn't an insane amount of money, one can assume this isn't Kirk's only source of income.

Kirk started Turning Point USA with Bill Montgomery. Montgomery spent his entire career in marketing, but when he retired, he became and formed this organization with Kirk. Montgomery was Kirk's mentor, having met when Kirk was 18. Since Montgomery spent his professional life in marketing, one can presume he taught Kirk a lot about marketing.

But that relationship came to end on July 28, 2020 when Montgomery died from covid-19.

Turning Point USA started out building chapters on college campuses that promoted Kirk (who was 18 at the time) and Kirk's "ideas" he called a "conservatarian" brand of capitalism.
