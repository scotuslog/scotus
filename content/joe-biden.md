# Joe Biden Needs to Retire
It's hard for Democrats, and so-called moderates to choke down this fact, but Joe Biden is not doing well as president. That was true even before Biden fist-bumped the Saudi Crown Prince - a man who brutally executed an American journalist.

It is [a fact](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/26/politics/biden-administration-khashoggi-report/index.html) that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman executed Washington Post Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in 2018. Khashoggi was critical of the Saudi royal family and opposed the war in Yemen. 

Biden was emphatic on the campaign trial that bin Salman would be an outcast - totally isolated. Now look at Biden's face as he fist-bumps bin Salman. I really wonder if Biden knows what's going on here. I'm not suggesting Biden is senile, just that he's old and out of touch. 

## Out of Step
A few days ago, Biden said that abortion rights activists were out of step with mainstream American politics. They're too crazy for Joe, with all their talk about women controlling their own bodies.

In his state of the union speech, Biden passionately rejected the Black Lives Matter movement when he said he wasn't going to "defund the police," he said he is going to "fund the police." Biden got a standing ovation for that line.

Biden has been saying for months that the pandemic is over. It is not over, but Biden and Fauci are moving on. Last holiday season, Biden sent everyone tests AFTER the holidays were over. That money for police, Biden is taking some of the COVID money and giving it to cops instead.

And what was that about when Biden shook hands with someone who wasn't there?

## 2024 or Before
At the very least, Biden can not run for reelection. He will lose against the likely GOP nominee - Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. 

If Biden is on the ballot in 2024, I will have a hard time voting for him, I might just leave it blank for president. I can't support someone who consistently makes the wrong choice about important issues and alienates base activists. It's elitism that Biden doesn't think he needs us. 

And for the record, executing journalists is supposed to be really, really bad - unforgivable.
