This is a website about the most powerful court in our country. It consists of nine unelected, yet extremely powerful, lawyers. Most people know very little about the Supreme Court justices.

While it's true, there is a lot one can learn about John Roberts on his Wikipedia page, but encyclopedias have a certain voice and limited usefulness. 

This website is meant to seek the Truth about each of the Supreme Court justices. The extreme hard right turn the court has taken, particularly after Mitch McConnell effectively stole two seats that the Republican party didn't deserve.

The Supreme Court's usefulness in a democracy has always been questionable, but in its current form the Supreme Court is demonstrably anti-democratic and anti-american. The court serves a small minority - the elite.

The purpose of this website is to shine light on the Supreme Court with the goal that the court either be abolished or radically reformed into a court that serves democracy and the people.
