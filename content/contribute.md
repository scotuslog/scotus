# Activate Yourself

One of us will likely not save this nation from collapsing into a fascist state - a failed democracy - on our own. However, if all of us take just a small amount of time to do something positive politically, we can change the world.

Like most people, it can be a struggle to find something that you can do, that won't eat up your entire life, but is also useful. 

That's why I created this website. 

I was searching for something that I could do that could make a difference in protecting our struggling democracy. I don't have tons of free time, but I do have lots of tech skills and I used to be a reporter. I put both of those skills together and made this website.

## Open Volunteer Positions
These are volunteer positions. There is no application. You won't be interviewed. The idea is that if you want to work on any of the available assignments, you've got the job. 

The only requirement is that you demonstrate that you can properly update this website's source repository by assigning an assignment to yourself.

You can view the current available assignments [here](assignments).
