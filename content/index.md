# Supreme Court of the United States of America
Since day one of enacting the Constitution, there's been a Supreme Court. 

James Madison liked the idea of the "national judiciary" constructed as various tribunals chosen by Congress. Others wanted the federal judiciary to be able to veto 
the president.

In the end, we largely have today what they designed at the time, a small governing body of lawyers on the bench for life, and beholden to no voters.

The first Supreme Court nominated by President George Washington had five justices.
 * John Jay for chief justice
 * John Rutledge
 * William Cushing
 * Robert H. Harrison replaced by James Iredell when Harrison didn't want to do it.
 * James Wilson
 * John Blair Jr. as associate justices.
