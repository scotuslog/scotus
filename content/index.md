# Welcome to S.C.O.T.U.S.
This website is about the Supreme Court of the United States of America. One of the first things you will notice about this website is that there is not much content. 

The purpose of this website is to shine some light on the Supreme Court, which operates very much in the dark. 

This site launched quietly in December 2021 with the goal of crowd-sourcing the content, let's see how it goes.

## Supreme Court of the United States of America
Since day one of enacting the Constitution, there's been a Supreme Court. 

James Madison liked the idea of the "national judiciary" constructed as various tribunals chosen by Congress. Others wanted the federal judiciary to be able to veto the president.

In the end, we largely have today what they designed at the time, a small governing body of lawyers on the bench for life, and beholden to no voters.

The first Supreme Court nominated by President George Washington had five justices.
 * John Jay for chief justice
 * John Rutledge
 * William Cushing
 * Robert H. Harrison replaced by James Iredell when Harrison didn't want to do it.
 * James Wilson
 * John Blair Jr. as associate justices.
