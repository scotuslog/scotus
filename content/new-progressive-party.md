# The Left Needs a New Progressive Party
The Democratic Party cost us the Supreme Court. When Scalia died and President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, they let Mitch McConnell steal that seat. McConnell's "argument" that Obama can't appoint a Supreme Court justice one year from the election was obvious bullshit. Sure, some Democrats pissed and moaned a bit about how mean McConnell is, but there was no full-throated, concerted, shout down of this authoritarian crap McConnell was slinging. Democrats were happy to just let the seat go. 

The theft of Scalia's seat went on to let Donald Trump appoint three Supreme Court justices. The Supreme Court is effectively gone for at least a generation.

## Packing the Court
One solution to Trump's evangelical Supreme Court justices is to expand the court to more than nine justices. President Franklin Roosevelt tried to do this with the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Procedures_Reform_Bill_of_1937](Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937).

Roosevelt was unsuccessful. It's difficult to imagine Biden and the current class of Democrats in DC pulling off something as bold as expanding the Supreme Court. Just recently, Democrats struggled to get a simple debt ceiling increase passed.

## A New Progressive Party
Another solution to our Supreme Court problem, and really many of our current political problems can be solved with a New Progressive Party.

It's true that no one has ever and will never create a viable political party not named Democratic or Republican, even though it's actually happened a bunch of times, but hear me out.

The New Progressive Party doesn't have to win a majority of the House or the Senate, it just needs to be successful enough scare the Democrats. 

## Scaring the Democrats
Democrats in DC need to be scared because they are far too comfortable in their positions of power. That's why they don't feel like they need to listen to the people, because they don't. The people are merely just voters that the politicians only need to care about when it's election time. Politicians have a vested interest in having to worry about as few voters as possible. 

But if there was a New Progressive Party picking off seats here and there, maybe they'd get nervous enough to do what we want them to do - sometimes. The New Progressive Party doesn't need to go after Democratic seats, it can run candidates against weak and goofy Republicans. But if a Democrat falls on their face, the New Progressive Party can step in to fill that void.

## Money
To create a New Progressive Party requires millions and millions of dollars. So if anyone has millions and millions of dollars to donate to this, that would be great. If anyone has any ideas about how millions and millions of dollars could be raised via fundraising, that would be cool.

## Expertise
To create a New Progressive Party requires lawyers and people who know how to create a political party. If you're someone like that, help.

## Conclusion
This won't happen. No one will want to be seen as challenging the Democratic Party. Americans have been conditioned to believe that we have a two-party system and that's just how it is. But if one spends some time reading what the framers of the constitution thought about political parties, one would learn that a two-party system they did not create.

Democrats and Republicans have built a system in which they are in complete control. They've boxed out all of the competition. So in a practical sense, it is impossible to create a viable alternative to the Democratic and Republican parties.

But it is possible to win US House seats with enough money and some exciting candidates.
