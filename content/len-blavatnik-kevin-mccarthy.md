Blavatnick's "employer" is called Access Industries. It's a company which apparently buys access to politicians?

It's not just Republicans either. Also in November 2021, Blavatnik donated $10,800 to the "Friends of Schumer." Then in July 2021, the Russian oligarch donated $5,000 to Schumer.

The DCCC can't be left out on the fun. In June 2021, Blavatnik was kind enough to donated $127,750 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
