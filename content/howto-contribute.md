# How To Submit Your Writing and Research

The process to submit stories and content to this website is quite simple, but for non-technical people, it can be kind of confusing.

The website is very simple technology. There is no database or admin interface to manage the content and stories. Everything is a text file and managed via Github.com.

To submit content, that's done via Github.com.

Git is a version control system used in most software development projects. In this context, Git is being used to manage not just source code, but content. At the end of the day, a text file about Clarence Thomas' life is practically no different than application source code.

* Researcher Early Life through College - Need people to dig into the lives of each justice from birth to graduating from college. If there was a birth announcement in a local paper, can we get a scan of it? Are there any recent interviews with people who discuss the justice's formative years and refer to anyone by name who can be researched or interviewed? What about photos of the justice when they're a kid?
