# Activate Yourself

One of us will likely not save this nation from collapsing into a fascist state - a failed democracy - on our own. However, if all of us take just a small amount of time to do something positive politically, we can change the world.

Like most people, it can be a struggle to find something that you can do, that won't eat up your entire life, but is also useful. 

That's why I created this website. 

I was searching for something that I could do that could make a difference in protecting our struggling democracy. I don't have tons of free time, but I do have lots of tech skills and I used to be a reporter. I put both of those skills together and made this website.

## Open Volunteer Positions
These are volunteer positions. There is no application. You won't be interviewed. The idea is that if you want to work on any of these "jobs" listed, you've got it. The only requirement is that you update this file in Git using a pull request to add your name to the list of assignees for the job. Once your pull request is approved, it's your assignment. It's possible for more than one person to be assigned to a job.

* Researcher Early Life through College - Need people to dig into the lives of each justice from birth to graduating from college. If there was a birth announcement in a local paper, can we get a scan of it? Are there any recent interviews with people who discuss the justice's formative years and refer to anyone by name who can be researched or interviewed? What about photos of the justice when they're a kid?
