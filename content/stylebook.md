# S.C.O.T.U.S Stylebook

The writing on this website must be crisp, clean, to the point and brutally honest.

The purpose of this website is not to tell both sides of the story, nor is it to be objective.

The people who run this website have taken the position that the Supreme Court is a threat to our democracy, and knowing more about those men and women who sit on that bench is a worthwhile endeavor.

Our style is to be bold and fearless, and we never lie.

In terms of how to write something, refer to the AP Stylebook. For example, is Virginia really a state, no it's a common wealth. Do I write Virginia Common Wealth or Commonwealth Virinia? Refer to the latest AP Stylebook for these sorts of questions. This website has no defined exceptions, we're adhering to the AP Stylebook. If in doubt, use your best judgement.
