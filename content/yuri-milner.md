# Who is Yuri Milner?
A casual Internet search for Yuri Milner doesn't provide much information about this "influential tech investor."

That's how Forbes describes Milner in a [thin profile](https://www.forbes.com/profile/yuri-milner/?sh=7af4c8c95e26) of the 60-year-old Russian with Israeli citizenship. 

Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Airbnb, these are some of the key investments Milner 
has made as a founding partner in DST Global venture capital firm.

Forbes pegs Milner's net worth at $7.3 billion.

Milner doesn't seem to be considered an oligarch, according the information gathered about him so far. Milner's firm DST Global was seeded with money from Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov. 

Milner and Usmanov's early investment in Facebook christened Milner tech investor royalty. That's how it works. Throw a bunch of money around and Americans won't 
care who you are.
