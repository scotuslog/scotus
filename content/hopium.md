# Hopium
The Democratic party is intoxicated on hopium.

Hopium is a drug that as taken over the Democratic party. It's not clear where hopium originates, but the first reference to "hopium" for me was on Oliver Willis' Twitter timeline. Where hopium came from is less important than the fact that it is dominating Democratic politics right now.

Evidence of hopium addiction can be found everywhere. The Supreme Court has taken away body autonomy to every woman in this country, and the response from Democrats is donate money and vote. 

The underlying assertion here is that by giving Democrats our money and voting for them, HOPEfully, they will pass laws that fix things and give women back their rights.

And any criticism directed at Democratic leaders is immediately slapped down by Democratic rank and file all gassed up on hopium. 

"You can't criticize Biden. He's perfect. So is Pelosi. You just need to vote and have hope."

Democrats need to recognize that they have a problem, because hopium addiction is a disease, but it can be treated.
