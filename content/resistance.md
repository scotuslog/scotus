# Steve Schmidt
I've never been a Steve Schmidt fan. I think these political people are paid liars. They will do and say whatever they need to get paid. So what they truly
believe is impossible to know.

However, Steve Schmidt has proven to be a strong voice rejecting GOP fascism. 

For posterity, here's a twitter rant Schmidt posted on May 10, 2022.
