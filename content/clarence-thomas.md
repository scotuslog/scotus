# Clarence Thomas
![Clarence Thomas](%assets_url%/clarence-thomas.jpg)

Since October 23, 1991, Clarence Thomas has been a United States Supreme Court Justice. Thomas was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to fill Justice Thurgood Marshall's seat. 

That was a critical seat for the Republicans to be able to fill. Since Thomas, the court has been forever turning to the right. 

Of the nine justices seated today, Democrats have appointed only three. What makes that even more shocking is that the Republican party has only won the popular vote for president once since 1988. And that one time was 2004, predicated on Bush not winning a majority in 2000, and then being appointed by the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore. That was when the GOP realized that they really could steal the White House.

Anyone older than 45 remembers that Bush's nomination of Thomas was not a smooth one. Anita Hill worked for Thomas and said that Thomas was sexually inappropriate with her. Even then-Senator Joe Biden got in on the belittling of Ms. Hill. It was a particularly sad period for this nation in what would be decades filled with sad periods.

Thomas has proven to be what everyone expected him to be, a rightwing fanatic with a total lack of interest in defending the actual constitution. 

[Just recently](https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/01/court-rebuffs-trumps-bid-to-block-release-of-documents-related-to-jan-6-riot/), the Supreme Court rejected a case by Donald Trump that would have destroyed the belief that there's only one president at time.

Thomas was the only dissent in the 8-1 to decision. His position is a radical one. Had the court ruled in favor of Trump, it would have given former presidents the power to overrule decisions made by the current, democratically elected president.

And there's Thomas' wife Virginia Thomas. Ginni has been a right-wing "activist" for decades. And even among right-wing activists, Ginni is on the goofy fridge. Even Trump said she's a "wacko."

[Jane Mayer in the New Yorker recently wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court) that Ginni Thomas believes that America is facing existential threats like the "deep state," the "fascist left," and "transsexual fascists."

Ginni Thomas doesn't just believe these threats are real, she's actively working to combat them.

When the January 6 insurrection was taking place, Ginni Thomas used a non-partisan private email list to communicate with former clerks of her husband to encourage people on the list to support the insurrection.

According [a story on CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/02/politics/ginni-thomas-clarence-thomas-supreme-court/index.html), Ginni Thomas encouraged the former clerks and their family members on the email to "celebrate" Trump rioters in DC. 

It wasn't just in private.

Ginni Thomas reportedly, "encouraged her Facebook followers to watch the day's events unfold on conservative news media, writing, 'LOVE MAGA people!!!!'"

"GOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP or PRAYING," she wrote.

Not everyone who clerks for a Supreme Court justice is a right-wing ding dong, some of them are actual liberals. Obviously, some people on that list were offended by Ginni Thomas' messages.

When Ginni Thomas sent those messages to those former clerks and their families, she was engaging in politics. She felt entitled to use her rare position of power - being married to a Supreme Court justice - and to use it for political gain.

Ginni Thomas isn't just spamming private email lists and annoying people, she's active with critical right-wing fanatics.

She has been on the board for the Council for National Policy. It's a dark money group that hooks up the wealthy with the powerful. Ginni Thomas is also associated with Turning Point USA. That's a pro-Trump group founded by right-wing numbnut Charlie Kirk. Kirk boasted about sending busloads of traitors to DC on January 6.

Obviously, not everyone is impressed with the Ginni and Clarence partnership.

[As Jane Mayer reported in her story](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court), Stephen Gillers, a law professor at N.Y.U. and judicial ethicist said, "Ginni Thomas is behaving horribly, and she's hurt the Supreme Court and the administration of justice. It's reprehensible."

The problem isn't just Ginni's political activities, it's that her husband does not recuse himself from cases that involve her. 

The expectation for judges is that recusal is necessary whenever even the appearance of bias could be present. 

Gillers told Mayer that, "It doesn't require an actual conflict. The reason we use an appearance test is because we say the appearance of justice is as important as the fact of justice itself."

Clarence and Ginni Thomas are way beyond "appearing" to look corrupt. He has failed to recuse himself in several critical cases that his wife has been involved. 

It would be interesting to know how many times Thomas has ruled in an unexpected way on a case with political ramifications. 

## Ginni Thomas Early
Ginni Lamp grew up in a very far right-wing family in Nebraska. Her parents were politically active in the Barry Goldwater campaign. In the New Yorker [Jane Mayer wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court) that Ginni's father was a housing developer in and around Omaha. Mayer reported that her parents formed the "backbone" of the Goldwater campaign in Nebraska.

Whatever ones opinions are of Goldwater, he was the first of what would become the modern conservative. It was after Goldwater when the GOP slid harder to the right, embraced the so-called "southern strategy," and diviseness as a means to "win." That's not to say Goldwater caused this to all happen, but he would become an early adopter of what Reagan would eventually do successfully in 1980.

Naturally, in the 1960s, Goldwater often attracted a lot of goofballs. 

[Mayer spoke with a neighbor](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court) who grew up across the street from the Lamps.

"Her parents were the roots of the modern, crazy Republican Party," said writer Kurt Andersen. "My parents were Goldwater Republicans, but even they thought the Lamp family was nuts."

Ginni's life during those early formative years are marked with privilege, sketchy choices, but it works out because her family's well-connected.

She goes to college at Creighton University in Omaha. Creighton is a small Christian college. Ginni attends law school at Creighton as well.

After college, her well-connected father got Ginni a job working for a Republican running for Congress. The candidate won and Ginni followed him to Washington. Ginni flunked the bar exam and somehow got hooked up with a cult called Lifespring. It was apparently a bunch of women stripping down naked and making fun of each other's body fat. That sounds healthy.

Eventually Ginni left the weird cult and went to work for the Chamber of Commerce to prevent women from realizing equal pay for equal work.

All of this history is derived [from the Jane Mayer story in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/is-ginni-thomas-a-threat-to-the-supreme-court).
