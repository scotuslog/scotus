# Clarence Thomas
![Clarence Thomas](%assets_url%/clarence-thomas.jpg)

Since October 23, 1991, Clarence Thomas has been a United States Supreme Court Justice. Thomas was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to fill Justice Thurgood Marshall's seat. 

That was a critical seat for the Republicans to be able to fill. Since Thomas, the court has been forever turning to the right. 

Of the nine justices seated today, Democrats have appointed only three. What makes that even more shocking is that the Republican party has only won the popular vote for president once since 1988. And that one time was 2004, and predicated on Bush not winning a majority in 2000 and being appointed by the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore.

Bush's nomination of Thomas was not a smooth one. Anita Hill worked for Thomas and said that Thomas was sexually inappropriate with her. Even then-Senator Joe Biden got in on the belittling of Ms. Hill. It was a particularly sad day for this nation in what would be decades of sad days.

Thomas has proven to be what every expected him to be, a rightwing fanatic with a total lack of interest in defending the actual constitution. 

[Just recently](https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/01/court-rebuffs-trumps-bid-to-block-release-of-documents-related-to-jan-6-riot/), the Supreme Court rejected a case by Donald Trump that sought to allow that a former president has the power to decide what the current president can do while in office. The concept of there being only one president at a time doesn't interest Thomas. He's motivated purely by rightwing "conservative" ideology.

His wife, Ginni Thomas is an active rightwing "activist." And she's one of the goofier ones too. 

When the January 6 insurrection was taking place, Ginni Thomas used a non-partisan email list used to communicate with former clerks of her husband to encourage people on the list to support the insurrection.

According [a story on CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/02/politics/ginni-thomas-clarence-thomas-supreme-court/index.html), Ginni Thomas encouraged the former clerks and their family members on the email to "celebrate" Trump rioters in DC. 

She reportedly, "encouraged her Facebook followers to watch the day's events unfold on conservative news media, writing, 'LOVE MAGA people!!!!'"

"GOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP or PRAYING," she wrote.

Not everyone who clerks for a Supreme Court justice is a rightwing ding dong, some of them are actual liberals, and so some people on this list were offended by Ginni Thomas' messages.

That's one of the problems with "conservative" ideology in America. It's like Christianity in that it's by default correct and should always been given a safe space to exist. 

Ginni Thomas probably sent those messages to those former clerks and their families because thinks that whatever she thinks, because she's a "Christian" "conservative," she's automatically correct. And because she's already correct - obviously - people NEED to hear what she has to say. She's speaking the truth told her by god himself.
